  <h1>RSS Rewrite</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>A tool for rewriting parts of an RSS feed and serving it.</strong>
  </p>
</div>

I wrote it specifically for modifying links to podcast episodes.

One Polish medium offers only fragments of episodes on their official
feed for premium subscribers but it's enough to remove "_FRAGMENT"
from the URL.

It still shows episode duration of the fragment, as I can't modify
metadata without having to download the file and check it during podcast
refresh. But when you play the episode it is correct.
