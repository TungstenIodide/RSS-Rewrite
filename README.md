  <h1>RSS Rewrite</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>A tool for rewriting parts of an RSS feed and serving it.</strong>
  </p>
</div>


Onet offers premium subscribers only fragments of podcasts over RSS, forcing the use of their mobile application.

Not anymore.

The `feeds.json.example` is preconfigured for Stan Wyjatkowy and Raport Miedzynarodowy.
Just paste the URLs of your premium feeds.

Stan Wyjatkowy works reliably.
Raport has inconsistent addresses, with the same URL fragment having multiple potential variants. YMMV

Episode lengths are wrong in the feeds. Writing correct ones would require downloading each episode.
